Create a 9-slide 16:9 deck titled:
“OpsAtlas: Flow-as-Code for Operational Excellence”

Audience: Director of Engineering, SRE leads
Tone: crisp, executive; minimal design (white/charcoal, accent #2F80ED)
Placeholders: [Director Name], [Your Name], [Date]
Tools context: Bitbucket, Jira, Dynatrace, Splunk

Add SPEAKER NOTES (3–5 bullets) per slide.

SLIDE 1 — Title
- Title, subtitle: “Map request flows in CI; auto-release notes; ground SRE & AI agents.”
- Footer: [Your Name], [Date]

SLIDE 2 — TL;DR
- One line: “Keep request-flow diagrams & checkpoint specs in Git on every PR; auto-generate Jira→Release Notes; alerting next.”

SLIDE 3 — Why (Pain & Urgency)
- No current map of request paths → slow incidents
- Flow drift invisible in PRs → monitoring gaps
- Manual release notes → consumers don’t know what to watch

SLIDE 4 — Outcomes (Targets)
- ≥95% PRs “flow-verified” in 4 weeks
- 100% releases auto-noted; draft time <5 min
- MTTR −20% on changes touching updated flows (within 2 sprints)

SLIDE 5 — Concept (Architecture)
- Diagram: Dev Commit → Bitbucket CI (CodeExplorer “Cartographer”) → Flow artifacts (Mermaid+SVG+flow.json) → Checkpoint YAML (“Waypoints”) → Release Notes
- Future: Terraform “Watchtower” compiles YAML → Dynatrace/Splunk alerts

SLIDE 6 — Cadence (PR & CI)
- Pre-commit module-only generation
- PR: CI regenerates & compares; label “flow-verified” or fail on drift
- Nightly DriftScan on main

SLIDE 7 — Release Notes (Jira→Commits→Modules)
- Pull Sprint issues → linked commits
- Highlight changed modules & checkpoints + consumer watchlist
- Publish to Bitbucket Releases + Markdown artifact

SLIDE 8 — Plan, Price, Perils (one slide)
- Plan: M1 Advisory gate (2 pilots) → M2 Module UX + checkpoint draft → M3 Enforce gate + notes → M4 Expand + finalize Terraform spec
- Price: 0.5 SRE + 0.5 Platform + 2 Dev champions (0.2 ea) for 6 weeks
- Perils→Mitigations: dev friction (pre-commit + advisory), nondeterministic diagrams (pinned versions), Jira link gaps (commit linting)

SLIDE 9 — Next Step
- Ask: “Approve 2-service pilot (checkout, catalog) and Jira/CI access by [Date].”
- Owners: Decision—[Director Name]; Execution—
