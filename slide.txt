Create a 12–14 slide 16:9 PowerPoint deck titled:
“OpsAtlas: Flow-as-Code for Operational Excellence”

Audience: Director of Engineering + SRE leads
Tone: crisp, executive-friendly, technically credible
Design: modern, minimal; white/charcoal background, accent color #2F80ED; consistent icon set; 2–3 colors max; no clipart

Include SPEAKER NOTES under each slide (3–6 bullets, ~60–90 words).
Assume Bitbucket + Jira + Dynatrace + Splunk; use placeholders [Director Name], [Your Name], [Date].

=== SLIDE OUTLINE ===

1) Title
- Title: OpsAtlas: Flow-as-Code for Operational Excellence
- Subtitle: “Map request flows in CI, auto-publish release notes, and ground SRE & AI agents in a single source of truth.”
- Footer: Presenter, Role, [Date]
- Visual: simple line-map motif or network graph icon

2) TL;DR (One-liner)
- Big line: “Keep request-flow diagrams & checkpoint specs in Git on every PR; auto-generate Jira→Release Notes; alerting next.”
- 3 bullets: Flow-as-Code cadence • Module-only generation • Checkpoint YAML → Terraform alerts (future)

3) Why (Pain & Urgency)
- Bullets:
  • No single, current map of request paths → slow incident triage
  • Flow drift invisible in PRs → monitoring gaps
  • Manual, inconsistent release notes → consumers don’t know what to watch
- Callout: “Now” = growing service count + faster deploys → higher risk without automation
- Visual: simple “Pain → Cost” diagram

4) Outcome (Success Metrics)
- Targets (with numbers):
  • ≥95% PRs that touch code carry “flow-verified” in 4 weeks
  • 100% releases auto-publish notes with changed modules/checkpoints; draft time <5 min
  • MTTR −20% for changes touching updated flows within 2 sprints
- Visual: KPI tiles

5) Concept Overview (Architecture)
- Boxes/Arrows diagram:
  Dev Commit → Bitbucket CI (CodeExplorer “Cartographer”) → Flow artifacts (Mermaid+SVG+flow.json) → Checkpoint YAML (“Waypoints”) → Release Notes Generator (Jira+Commits)
  Future: “Watchtower” Terraform compiles YAML → Dynatrace/Splunk alerts
- Label components: Cartographer, FlowGate, Waypoints, Watchtower, DriftScan

6) Cadence (PR & CI Flow)
- Swimlane graphic (Dev / CI / Review):
  • Pre-commit: module-only flow generation
  • PR: CI regenerates, compares; adds “flow-verified” or fails on drift
  • Nightly on main: DriftScan confirms zero drift
- Side note: deterministic outputs; pinned versions

7) Module-Only Generation (Scope, not whole service)
- Bullets:
  • Fast local flow for touched module; external edges shown as stubs
  • Artifacts per module: flow.mmd, flow.svg, flow.flow.json
  • Explicit boundaries via module.flow.toml (entries, includes, owners)
- Visual: small module diagram with external touchpoints

8) Release Notes from Jira → Commits → Changed Areas
- Bullets:
  • Parse Sprint board → issues → linked commits/PRs
  • Summarize impacted modules & checkpoints + consumer watchlist
  • Output as Bitbucket Release notes page & Markdown artifact
- Visual: simple funnel (Jira → Commits → Modules → Notes)

9) Checkpoint YAML (“Waypoints”) [Preview]
- Bullets:
  • Declarative nodes = checkpoints; intents = metrics/logs/traces/SLOs
  • Owners & routing embedded (Slack, PagerDuty)
  • Provider-agnostic selectors (Dynatrace/Splunk hints)
- Show a tiny, readable YAML snippet (3–6 lines) as illustration

10) Proof (Feasibility & Assumptions)
- Bullets:
  • Prior art: working CodeExplorer mode; deterministic Mermaid outputs
  • Bitbucket Pipelines pattern for regen+diff standard
  • Assumptions: Jira issue keys in commits; service tags present in Dynatrace/Splunk

11) Plan (Scope → Milestones → Non-Goals)
- Scope bullets:
  • Enforce “flow-verified” gate on PRs for changed modules
  • Auto-draft checkpoint.yaml from flow.json
  • Generate release notes per sprint/release
- Milestones (with target dates placeholders):
  • M1 [Week 1]: Advisory gate on 2 pilot services; nightly drift
  • M2 [Week 2–3]: Module UX + checkpoint draft + Jira linking POC
  • M3 [Week 4]: Enforce gate; publish release notes; SRE dashboard
  • M4 [Week 5–6]: Expand to 5 services; finalize Terraform spec
- Non-Goals: org-wide dependency graph, auto-remediation, ML baselines (phase-1)

12) Price (Effort, Timeline, Dependencies)
- Table:
  Roles | FTE | Duration
  SRE | 0.5 | 6 weeks (pilot)
  Platform Eng | 0.5 | 6 weeks
  2 App Dev Champions | 0.2 each | 6 weeks
- Dependencies: Bitbucket Pipelines, Jira API, commit linting, Dynatrace/Splunk tags, Terraform workspace (phase-2)

13) Perils (Risks & Mitigations)
- Risk → Mitigation list:
  • Dev friction → pre-commit helpers, module-only default, advisory period
  • Diagram nondeterminism → pinned versions, sort nodes/edges, SVG
  • Repo bloat → store Mermaid+SVG only; artifact history optional
  • Jira link gaps → commit message linting; PR template checks
  • False coverage → nightly drift + SRE review of checkpoint YAML

14) Next Step (Decision & Owner)
- Ask: “Approve 2-service pilot (checkout, catalog), team allocation, and Jira/CI access by [Date].”
- Owners: Decision — [Director Name]; Execution — [Your Name]
- Visual: simple checkbox timeline

Appendix (optional auto-hidden if 12 slides max)
- Glossary: Cartographer, FlowGate, Waypoints, Watchtower, DriftScan
- Example flow diff (before/after)
- Example release notes section

=== GLOBAL SETTINGS ===
- Typography: Title 36–44pt; body 18–22pt; ample whitespace
- Add small footer with project name “OpsAtlas”
- Use consistent icons for: code, CI, diagram, YAML, alert bell, Jira, Bitbucket
- No dense code blocks; any YAML/CLI snippets must fit 2–3 lines with legible font
- Each slide: no more than 5 bullets; avoid paragraphs in the slide body
- Include speaker notes with crisp narrative and explicit “why it matters”

Deliverables: .pptx (editable) + .pdf
