⏱ SCENE 1 — GOAL SETTING (0:00–1:00)

Manager’s desk. NJ sits eagerly.

M (opening laptop with 20 tabs):
Alright NJ, time to set your OKRs—your destiny.

NJ:
Sir I thought we’ll just decide my work?

M (grand tone):
No no. OKRs are… ambitious, measurable, inspirational organisational philosophies.
Simple, right?

NJ:
Sir this sounds like a Christopher Nolan movie.

M:
Exactly.
Welcome to Corporate Inception.

NJ (gulp):
Okay… my objective is just: “Learn and deliver well.”

M (typing furiously):
Good. Translating:
“Drive transformational uplift in platform reliability via next-gen initiative ownership.”

NJ:
Sir… am I joining Avengers?

M:
Same vibe.
Now KR1:
“120% uplift in operational cadence.”

NJ:
Operational cadence?

M:
Zumba… but with tickets.

NJ (blink):
Sir how will you explain this at mid-year?

M:
Easy.
“Great progress, but there is scope.”

NJ:
Scope for what?

M (serious):
Scope… for more scope.

NJ stares at audience:
NJ:
Corporate Inception.

Lights cut.

⏱ SCENE 2 — MID-YEAR CHECK-IN (1:00–2:25)

M sits with laptop. NJ enters with confidence.

M:
So NJ, tell me achievements.

NJ (excited):
Sir, I finished two features, helped in production issue, documented onboarding—

M (scrolling):
Hmm… but I don’t see it in the tool.

NJ:
Sir but YOU know I did it! You were ON the calls!

M (deadpan):
Beta…
If it’s not in the tool…
you didn’t do it.

NJ (existential collapse):
Corporate… Inception.

M:
Also… few of your OKRs changed.

NJ:
WHY?!

M:
Org OKR changed.
Because the OKR of that OKR changed.
Because its OKR changed due to some OTHER OKR changing.

NJ:
SIR WHAT KIND OF INCEPTION IS THIS?!

M (buttoning laptop):
Corporate. Inception.
Update everything.
P1 will help.

M exits heroically.

P1 enters like a mentor.

P1:
Chalo champ. Time to make your work sound important.

NJ:
Feature completed, incident helped, documented stuff…

ENTRY 1

P1:
Write:
“Proactively led critical incident to resolution.”

NJ:
But I only joined Zoom. Camera off.

P1:
Silent leadership. Elite skill.

NJ nods, impressed.

ENTRY 2

P1:
Next: “Cross-functional visibility expansion.”

NJ:
What's that!?

P1:
You engaged with the other team at the last townhall, no?

NJ:
Sir, I JUST asked where the washroom is.

P1 (proud):
Exactly.
And we ALL heard it.
High visibility.

NJ (slowly enlightened):
Corporate… Inception.

M returns.

M:
Updated?

NJ (proud):
Yes sir.

M:
Good.
Mid-year isn’t for rating.
It prepares your soul… for rating.

NJ stares into void.

Lights cut.

“Bell Curve Panchayat” — HR + two Managers.

HR:
Next rating: NJ’s peer.

Manager 2 (pleading):
Arre please, he’s been here long.
He has survived three HR portals.

HR (reverent):
Ah… ancient one.

Manager 1:
Fine. NJ gets “Solid Meets With Stretch.”

HR:
Good.
Please explain this in positive language that means nothing.

APPRAISAL TALK

Manager and NJ.

M (sweet corporate smile):
NJ, I really value your contributions… ownership… mindset…

NJ:
Sir… rating?

M:
“Solid Meets… with Stretch Elements.”

NJ:
What does that MEAN?

M:
Great work,
but not enough to disturb the bell curve.

NJ (broken monk):
Corporate… Inception.

NJ:
Increment?

M:
Yes!
A big one…
(beat)
…in responsibilities.

Corporate. Plot twist.
