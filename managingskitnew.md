Here it is — a tight, punchy, well-paced 6–7 minute mega-skit, combining:

Onboarding Chaos Trilogy (Entrance → Biometrics → Seat Saga)

Career Cycle Comedy Arc (OKRs → Mid-Year → Appraisal → Year-End Party)


Everything is stitched together into one flowing story, with natural transitions, consistent humour, and the “Corporate Inception” callback threaded through the entire piece.

You can perform this with 6–7 people very easily.

🎭 THE GREAT CORPORATE INCEPTION

A 6–7 minute Town Hall Performance


---

⭐ SCENE 1 – THE GRAND ENTRANCE (0:00–1:00)

Hero background music. NJ1 & NJ2 walk in slow motion toward the BIG vehicle gate.

NJ1:
Bro… first day. Time to make a MASS entry.

NJ2:
Let them FEEL our aura.

[Security Guard (SG) steps in dramatically.]

SG:
Bas bas bas. Where are your wheels?

NJ1:
Sir… wheels?

SG:
This gate is for CARS and BIKES.
Humans → small gate.
Unless you two are Transformers?

NJ2:
Sir my brain sometimes transforms.

SG:
Clearly.
Go to the SMALL gate.


---

⭐ SECOND GATE

[NJ1 & NJ2 scan dramatically.]

SG:
ID?

NJ1:
Card not ready yet…

NJ2:
Phone dying… like my hopes…

SG:
QR code? Temp pass? ANYTHING??

NJ1:
Sir I have Aadhaar.

SG:
Beta… this is JP Morgan, not RTO.

NJ2:
HR told us access is inside.

SG (philosophically):
To get inside, you must first BE inside.
Corporate physics, beta.

[NJ1 calls Manager.]

Manager (on phone):
Check your email.
Mobile badge already sent.

NJ2:
OH.
Sir look!

SG (sarcastic clap):
Wah. Official humans.
Now go… and walk with all the style you were practising.

[Hero music resumes. They enter again in slow motion.]


---

⭐ SCENE 2 – BIOMETRICS BLUNDER (1:00–2:00)

Inside lobby.

NJ1:
Biometrics? Easy bro. Like in spy movies.

NJ2 (placing finger):
BEEP — RED LIGHT

NJ2:
Eh?
Try nose?
Try cheek?
Maybe machine is shy?

STM:
Sir… machine is not shy. It’s just judging you.

NJ1 (waves at machine dramatically):
Recognize me… accept me…

STM (deadpan):
It's a machine, not your future in-laws.

NJ2:
Bro maybe we’re SECRET AGENTS and machine can’t handle us?

STM:
Sir this is not Mission Impossible.
Put your badge.
No hair flips.
Machine cannot handle that much style.

[Green light.]

NJ1:
Spy level unlocked. Kindergarten.


---

⭐ SCENE 3 – THE SEAT SAGA (2:00–3:00)

DAY 1 – Standing Desk Discovery

NJ1:
BRO… standing desks!!

NJ2:
It goes up AND down??

NJ1 (mimicking motor noise):
Whrrrrrrrrrrr—
Why so serious?

[Places Joker figurine on imaginary rising desk.]

NJ2:
Tomorrow… we rule this kingdom.


---

DAY 2 – Figurine Gone

NJ1:
BROOOO — JOKER IS GONE.

NJ2:
Someone stole the KING!

Senior Colleague (SC, sipping chai):
Welcome to HOT DESKING.
Seats here are like Bangalore auto fares — never guaranteed.

NJ1:
But we BOOKED!

SC:
Booking is a FEELING.
Reality is different.

NJ2:
Where do we keep our stuff then?

SC:
Cloud.
Or your bag.
Or tie AirTag to your chair.


---

[NJ1 & NJ2 sit next to Girl Colleague (GC). NJ1 peeks at her imaginary screen.]

NJ1:
Bro so many tabs.
One says “How to handle two charming joiners at once?”

GC (typing without looking):
Nah.
Just checking if I can access the POSH portal already.
For situations like THIS.

NJ1 & NJ2:
ABORT MISSION!

Lights shift to show transition from onboarding to performance year.


---

⭐ SCENE 4 – OKR DAY (3:00–4:00)

Meeting room. Manager with laptop full of tabs.

M:
Time to set your OKRs.

NJ1:
Sir I thought we just decide work?

M:
No no. OKRs are ambitious, measurable, inspirational, confusing organisational philosophies.
Simple.

NJ2:
Sir this sounds like a Nolan movie.

M:
Exactly.
Corporate Inception.


---

Objective Setting

NJ1:
“Learn and deliver well.”

M (typing like mad):
“Drive transformational uplift in platform reliability via next-gen initiative ownership.”

NJ2:
Sir this is Avengers language.

M:
Same ecosystem.


---

KR1

M:
“120% uplift in operational cadence.”

NJ1:
What IS operational cadence?

M:
Zumba… but with tickets.


---

NJ2:

Sir how will you explain all this in mid-year?

M (zen):
Great progress… but there is scope.


---

⭐ SCENE 5 – MID-YEAR CHECK-IN (4:00–5:00)

M (scrolling):
NJ1, I don’t see any of your work in the tool.

NJ1:
Sir YOU KNOW I did it!

M:
If it’s not in the tool…
you didn’t do it.

NJ1 (cracking mentally):
Corporate… Inception.


---

OKR change confusion

M:
Also your OKRs changed because the org OKR changed because the OKR of that OKR changed because something else changed.

NJ2:
WHAT KIND OF INCEPTION IS THIS?!

M:
Corporate Inception.
Update everything.
P1 will help.


---

P1 helps

P1:
Write this:
“Proactively led critical incident to resolution.”

NJ1:
I only joined Zoom… camera off.

P1:
Silent leadership.


---

P1:
Next: “Cross-functional visibility expansion.”

NJ2:
What’s that?

P1:
You asked about washroom in last town hall, right?

NJ2:
Yes?

P1:
And we ALL heard it.
High visibility.


---

⭐ SCENE 6 – APPRAISAL DAY (5:00–5:50)

Calibration room.

HR:
Next rating: NJ1’s peer.

Manager 2:
Please yaar, he’s been here LONG.
He has survived THREE HR portals.

HR (bows):
Ah… a veteran.

Manager 1 (defeated):
Fine. NJ gets Solid Meets… with Stretch.


---

Actual Appraisal

M:
NJ… you’ve shown ownership… mindset… collaboration…

NJ1:
Sir… rating?

M:
Solid Meets… with Stretch Elements.

NJ1:
Meaning?

M:
Great work…
but not enough to disturb the bell curve.

NJ2:
Corporate. Inception.

NJ1:
Increment?

M:
Yes — in responsibilities.


---

⭐ SCENE 7 – YEAR-END PARTY (5:50–7:00)

Music. Cups. Laughter.

HR:
Upload your smiles to the Fun@Work folder!

P2:
Next year pakka promotion!

P1:
2022 you said this.
2023 you said this.
2024 also.
Consistency is your real strength.


---

Final Enlightenment

NJ1:
Sir… what’s the secret to surviving corporate life?

M (finally human):
Document your work.
Take your leaves.
Find mentors.
Have boundaries.
And remember — rating ≠ worth.

P1:
And never volunteer for skits.

NJ2:
Too late.

All together (raising cups):
CORPORATE INCEPTION!

Lights OUT.
