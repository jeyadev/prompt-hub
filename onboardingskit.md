Here you go — your upgraded, high-energy, Indian-humour–infused improv versions of the three onboarding skits:

Main Entrance (Two New Joiners + Snarky Security Guard)

Biometrics Blunder (Spy mode + corporate paradox)

Seat Saga (Standing desk + Joker figurine + next-day disappearance)


I’ve rewritten them with timing, punchlines, and character rhythm that match the style of your Corporate Inception skits — sharper, more grounded in Indian workplace humour, and way more stage-friendly.

Let’s go scene by scene.

🎬 SCENE 1: JPMorgan Main Entrance – “Where are your wheels, beta?”

Characters:

New Joiner 1 (NJ1)

New Joiner 2 (NJ2)

Security Guard (SG)

Manager (brief cameo)


[Loud, over-the-top hero-entry music plays. NJ1 and NJ2 walk in slow motion, acting like it’s K.G.F. Chapter 3.]

NJ1 (low voice):
Bro… first day. Time to make an entry.

NJ2:
Let them FEEL our presence.

[They dramatically approach the BIG vehicle gate.]

SG (steps in like a final boss):
Bas bas bas bas bas.
Where are your wheels?

NJ1:
Uh… wheels?

SG (points at giant gate):
Beta, this gate is for cars, bikes, tractors, bulldozers…
Humans use the SMALL gate.
Unless…
(leans in)
you have wheels I can’t see.

NJ2 (panicking):
Sir I have roller skates at home, does that count?

SG (deadpan):
Only if you can commute from Whitefield to here in them.

[Crowd laughs. SG gestures toward small gate.]


---

⭐ SECOND GATE – “ID pls… oh, you don’t have?”

[NJ1 & NJ2 reach the small gate. Another beep machine. They strike a pose like they’re scanning retina for Mission Impossible.]

SG:
ID card?

NJ1:
Sir… uh… card is not ready yet.

SG:
Mobile badge?

NJ2:
Sir phone battery 2%. If I flash it, phone will faint.

SG:
QR code?
Temporary pass?
Email?
White-paper-with-your-name?
Anything??

NJ1:
Sir we have Aadhaar, PAN, even a Decathlon membership card.

SG (dramatic sigh):
Why will you use Decathlon card to enter JP Morgan?
Are you coming here to lift dumbbells or what?

NJ2:
Sir but we’re new joiners — HR told us we’ll get access inside.

SG:
Arre beta… to get inside, you first need to be inside.
This is corporate physics.

[NJ1 calls Manager.]

NJ1:
Sir security won't let us in!

Manager (on phone, amused):
Did you check your email?
You have a mobile badge already.
Just open, flash, and walk in like a pro.

[NJ2 opens email, flashes phone.]

SG (sarcastic clap):
Wah wah wah.
Badass entry music is fine…
at least now you’re officially humans.

NJ1 & NJ2 (restore swag):
Sir… now watch our REAL entry.

[Music resumes; they walk in slow motion again, flipping imaginary hair, while SG just shakes his head.]

🎬 SCENE 2: Biometrics Blunder – “Not Mission Impossible, beta”

Characters:

NJ1

NJ2

Security Tech Member (STM)



---

[NJ1 & NJ2 enter like they’re entering a secret airport hangar.]

NJ1:
Biometrics? Easy bro. Seen this in every spy movie.

NJ2:
Haan bro, retina scan, face scan, fingerprint — all same only.

[NJ2 places finger on machine. BEEP — RED LIGHT.]

NJ2:
Eh? Maybe it’s warming up?
(tries again)
BEEP — RED LIGHT.

NJ1:
Bro maybe you’re too advanced for the machine.
Maybe you're a SECRET AGENT and machine cannot handle your identity?

STM (deadpan, not impressed):
Sir… machine can handle more identity than Aadhaar database.
Please place properly.

[NJ1 now waves at the machine like he’s summoning a plane to land.]

NJ1:
Hey biometric machine… recognize me… I BELONG here…

STM:
Sir, it’s a machine, not your future in-laws.
Stop waving.

[NJ2 pushes face forward, tries to scan nose. Nothing happens.]

NJ2 (dramatic):
Can you show me if it works or is it just a fancy fan?

STM (firm):
Sir… this is not Mission Impossible.
No retina scan.
No hair flip.
Just put your badge.
And no… you are NOT Tom Cruise.

NJ1:
What about dramatic hair flip?

STM:
Machine is not designed to handle so much style.

[NJ1 & NJ2 finally scan correctly — GREEN LIGHT.]

NJ1 (to audience):
Entry complete. Spy training level: kindergarten.

🎬 SCENE 3: Seat Saga – “Why So Serious?”

Characters:

New Joiner 1 (NJ1)

New Joiner 2 (NJ2)

Senior Colleague (SC)

Girl Colleague (GC)



---

⭐ DAY 1 – Standing Desk Excitement

[NJ1 & NJ2 walk into the workspace.]

NJ1 (gasping):
Bro… LOOK!
STANDING DESKS!

NJ2:
It goes UP and DOWN?

NJ1 (excitedly pressing imaginary up/down button):
See bro…
(fakes SFX: whrrrrrrrrr going up)
Now going down — whoop… whoop… whoop
AYO EVEN Batman doesn’t have this tech!

NJ2:
We need to MARK our territory!
Bring out… The Joker.

[NJ1 pulls out tiny Joker figurine.]

NJ1 (in Joker voice):
Why… so… serious?

[They place figurine dramatically on the imaginary rising desk.]

NJ2:
Tomorrow… THIS shall be our kingdom.

Lights cut.

⭐ DAY 2 – Figurine Gone

[NJ1 rushes in first.]

NJ1 (screaming):
BROOOO—
WHERE IS MY JOKER!?
My desk… my king… gone!

NJ2 (spinning around):
Sir someone stole our seat! Corporate criminals!

SC (walks in sipping chai, calm):
Relax, kids.
Welcome to HOT DESKING.
Seats here are like Bangalore auto fares — never guaranteed.

NJ1:
But… we BOOKED!

SC:
Booking is an emotion, beta.
Reality is something else.

NJ2:
Where do we put our stuff then?

SC:
In the cloud.
Or your bag.
Better option: attach GPS tracker.

⭐ THE GIRL COLLEAGUE MOMENT

[NJ1 & NJ2 quickly sit at a random desk. GC is typing there.]

NJ1 (peeking at her screen softly):
Bro she has so many tabs open!
One tab looks like… “how to handle two charming joiners at once?”

GC (typing without looking up):
Nope.
I'm just checking if I can access the POSH portal already…
you know… for emergencies like THIS.

NJ1 & NJ2 (instantly stand up, terrified):
Abort mission! Abort mission!

GC waves sarcastically as they flee.
