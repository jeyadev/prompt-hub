Here it is — a single, coherent, theatre-style ACT, running 10–12 minutes, with clean transitions, a consistent comedic voice, emotional beats, corporate satire, Indian-local humour, recurring “Corporate Inception” callbacks, and a full onboarding → integration → performance cycle arc.

This is written like a proper stage play, with scenes flowing into each other smoothly, no repetition, balanced character load, and punchlines that land hard in an Indian town-hall setting.

(3 scenes, ~4 minutes)

🎬 SCENE 1: The Grand Entrance

Hero music plays. NJ1 & NJ2 walk in slow-motion like they're entering a KGF sequel. They head straight to the BIG vehicle gate.

SG (steps forward like Thanos):
Bas bas bas. Where are your wheels?

NJ1:
Sir… wheels?

SG:
This is for cars, bikes, trucks…
Not humans.
Unless you two are secretly Transformers?

NJ2:
Sir sometimes my brain transforms—

SG:
Clearly.
Small gate → that side.


---

SECOND GATE

NJ1 (posing with phone):
Sir scanning…

SG:
ID card?

NJ1:
Not ready yet.

NJ2:
Phone badge only 2% battery…

SG:
Temporary pass? QR? Email? Postcard? A chitti from HR?

NJ1:
Sir I have Aadhaar.

SG:
Beta… this is JP Morgan, not the RTO.

NJ2:
HR said access is inside…

SG (philosophically):
To get inside, you must first BE inside.
Corporate physics.

NJ1 calls Manager.

M (on phone):
Check your email. Badge already sent.

NJ2 (flashes phone proudly):
Sir see! We are official!

SG (sarcastic applause):
Wah. Humans unlocked.
Now go… continue your slow-motion entry.

NJ1 & NJ2 approach the biometric scanner confidently.

NJ2:
Spy mode ON.

NJ2 places finger. Machine goes RED.

NJ2:
Eh? Try nose?

NJ1 waves dramatically at scanner:
Machine… ACCEPT ME.

STM (deadpan):
Sir, it’s a machine, not your future in-laws.

NJ1:
Maybe I’m a SECRET AGENT?

STM:
This is NOT Mission Impossible.
Just tap your badge.
No hair flips.

NJ2 (taps badge – turns GREEN):
Spy training complete.
Kindergarten level.

DAY 1 – Standing Desk Discovery

NJ1 & NJ2 walk into workspace.

NJ1:
BRO… LOOK! Standing desks!

NJ2:
It goes up AND down?

Whrrrrrrrr— why so serious?

NJ1 puts a Joker figurine on the imaginary rising desk.

NJ2:
Kingdom secured. Tomorrow we rule.


---

DAY 2 – Desk Disappears

NJ1 (runs in):
BROOO— Joker is GONE!

NJ2:
Someone stole our empire!

SC (walks in calmly):
Welcome to HOT DESKING, kids.
Seats here are like Bangalore autos — never guaranteed.

NJ1:
But we BOOKED!

SC:
Booking is a feeling.
Reality is something else.

NJ2:
Where do we keep our stuff then?

SC:
Cloud.
Or your bag.
Or attach a GPS tracker.
Corporate wildlife is dangerous.

NJ1:
Bro even my EX was easier to operate.

GC (enters):
Again? Beta it’s been six months.
For hot water press THIS + THAT.
For cold water press THIS + THIS.
Simple.

NJ1:
Simple for YOU.
This machine is a Rubik’s Cube.

GC (shows one press + tap):
See? Done.

NJ1:
This is another Inception.

GC:
Anyway why do you look like your soul resigned?

NJ1:
Breakup. Need leave. Don’t know how to ask Manager.

GC:
Just put it in the system.
It’s auto-approved.

AUTO… approved?!

GenZ kids.
Skip your choco-moccachito nonsense.
Have iced tea.
Cool yourself down.

🎬 SCENE 5: The Certificate Saga

NJ2 and SC are in a meeting room. Laptop connected to Zoom. TM joins remotely.

NJ2 (holding stack of certificates):
Sir I did Data Analytics, AI, Python — all paid courses!

SC:
Good effort. But you didn’t have to pay.

NJ2:
What do you mean?

SC:
We have Go/Learning.
Everything is free — Python, Analytics, AI/ML…
Unlimited.

NJ2:
WAIT.
So I didn’t have to spend a rupee?!

TM on Zoom (loud):
TURN ON CAM PLEASE.

NJ2 (turns on camera awkwardly):
Sir I wasted money…

TM:
Of course!
Why pay when Go/Learning exists?
Indians and free stuff = soulmates.

Exactly.
Corporate Inception.

Sir how will you explain this at mid-year?

Scope for what?

Scope… for more scope.

Corporate Inception.

NJ1, I don’t see your work in the tool.

NJ1:
But SIR you KNOW I did it!

M:
Beta… if it’s not in the tool…
you didn’t do it.

NJ1:
Corporate Inception…


---

⭐ OKR Change Confusion

M:
Also your OKRs changed because the org OKR changed because the OKR of that OKR changed because something else changed.

NJ2:
SIR THIS IS MULTI-LAYERED NONSENSE.

M:
Corporate Inception.
Update everything.
P1 will guide.

High visibility.

Fine. Give NJ1 “Solid Meets with Stretch.”

NJ… you’ve shown ownership… mindset… collaboration…

NJ1:
Sir rating?

M:
Solid Meets… with Stretch Elements.

Corporate. Inception.

Yes — big one…
in responsibilities.

Corporate plot twist.

Document your work.
Take your leaves.
Find mentors.
