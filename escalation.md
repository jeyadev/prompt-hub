### **Escalation: General Principles**

This page describes the fundamental principles and best practices for escalating incidents in a **Banking API Gateway** context. It ensures that the right teams and decision-makers are involved at the right time to minimize impact, restore services quickly, and maintain seamless communications.

---

#### 1. **Purpose of Escalation**
Escalation is the process of bringing higher-level support, management, or specialized expertise into an incident resolution or decision-making process when standard procedures or frontline teams cannot resolve the incident within agreed timelines or severity thresholds.

- **Timely Intervention:** Prevents prolonged service degradation or major outages.  
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Ensures the right skill sets are involved without unnecessary overhead.  
- **Risk Mitigation:** Safeguards compliance, reputational standing, and customer trust by minimizing downtime.

#### 2. **When to Escalate**
1. **Exceeding SLA/SLO Targets:** If a P1 or P2 incident is nearing or surpassing the established MTTR or if standard troubleshooting is not yielding progress.  
2. **Resource Constraints:** If required subject matter experts (SMEs) are unavailable or existing teams are out of capacity to handle the incident.  
3. **Increased Business Impact:** Escalate early if widespread or high-profile systems are affected, or if the incident threatens compliance, financial, or reputational risk.  
4. **Management Visibility Needed:** Situations requiring executive approval, or if resolution depends on cross-functional decisions.

#### 3. **Escalation Tiers**
Typically, escalation follows a tiered approach:

1. **Level 1** – **Frontline Team / L1 Support**  
   - Initial triage and diagnosis  
   - Basic troubleshooting and known solutions  
2. **Level 2** – **Specialized Support / L2**  
   - Advanced troubleshooting, code-level fixes, deeper domain expertise  
3. **Level 3** – **Engineering / Development / L3**  
   - Complex root-cause analysis, architectural changes, or system-wide fixes  
4. **Management / Crisis Management**  
   - Strategic decisions, significant resource allocation, external communications or vendor escalations

#### 4. **Escalation Matrix**

| **Priority / Severity** | **Escalation Path**                  | **Escalation Trigger**                                          | **Escalation Contact**         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **P1 – Severity 1/2**   | L1 → L2 → L3 → Management             | No resolution within 15–30 mins; critical impact escalating      | Incident Commander, Duty Manager |
| **P2 – Severity 3**     | L1 → L2 → L3 → Management (as needed) | No resolution within 1 hr; partial impact remains unresolved     | Team Lead, SME, On-Call Engineer |
| **P3 – Severity 4**     | L1 → L2 (→ L3 if needed)              | No resolution within 4–8 hrs; user workaround remains unstable   | L2 Team, On-Call Specialists    |
| **P4 – Low**            | L1 → L2 / Maintenance Window          | Issue blocking planned rollout or negatively affecting SLAs      | L2 Team or Service Owner        |
| **P5 – Informational**  | L1 → (L2 if needed)                   | Escalate only if risk changes to an actual incident             | N/A                             |

#### 5. **Communication Guidelines**

- **Identify Stakeholders Early:** Use your incident stakeholder list to determine who needs to know about the escalation.  
- **Regular Updates:** Provide frequent status updates aligned with each priority’s cadence (e.g., every 30 mins for P1) to keep leadership, cross-functional teams, and external clients informed.  
- **Clear, Concise Messaging:** Avoid jargon in stakeholder communications. Focus on business impact, resolution steps, and estimated recovery times.  
- **Define Communication Channels:** Slack war rooms, Zoom calls, or email templates for escalations, ensuring consistent messaging.

---

#### 6. **Roles & Responsibilities**

- **Incident Commander** (P1/P2): Oversees the entire incident, ensures the right resources and decisions are made in real-time.  
- **Duty Manager**: Acts as the escalation point for cross-team or organizational issues.  
- **Engineering/Support Leads**: Provide specialized troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and coordination with external vendors.  
- **Management/Executives**: Approve major decisions, coordinate corporate communications, and handle high-level stakeholder relationships.

---

#### 7. **Escalation Do’s & Don’ts**

**Do**:  
- Escalate early if risk factors indicate potential for severe impact  
- Document all steps and decisions for clarity and post-incident analysis  
- Maintain calm, clear communication channels  

**Don’t**:  
- Wait until the situation is unmanageable before escalating  
- Over-communicate trivial details to stakeholders who only need the high-level overview  
- Bypass standard processes without valid justification
