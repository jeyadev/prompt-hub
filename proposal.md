Here’s a no-nonsense formula you can reuse:

Why → What → How → When/Cost → Risk → Proof → Next step

If you want it as a fill-in one-pager, use this “mad-libs” template:

Title: [Outcome in 3–5 words]

Executive line (1 sentence): We propose [solution] to achieve [target metric / business value] for [who] by [date], costing [₹/$/people].

Why (problem & value): [current pain / opportunity], impact [quantify baseline → target].

What (scope & non-goals): Includes [features/domains]; excludes [non-goals].

How (approach/architecture): [method, tools, integrations]; KPIs [X, Y, Z].

When/Cost (plan): Milestones [M1 date] → [M2] → [Go-Live]; budget [capex/opex].

Risk (top 3 + mitigations): [Risk → Mitigation] ×3.

Proof (credibility): [pilot data, benchmarks, prior wins, team].

Next step (decision ask): Approve [resources/scope] by [decision date].


Want a 5-sentence version for execs?

1. Why: Because [problem] costs [₹/time].


2. What: Deliver [outcome] measured by [KPI/target].


3. How: Using [approach/tools], within [constraints].


4. Plan & Cost: [Milestones], budget [₹], owners [names].


5. Risk & Ask: Key risks [A/B/C] with mitigations; approve by [date].



Tiny example (adapt it to your initiative):

Title: Automated Release Notes & Validation Map

Executive line: Propose an agent that compiles sprint stories + code diffs into release notes and flags consumer validation items, cutting prep time 80% by Nov 15, using Jira MCP + repo diffing; cost 2 eng-weeks.

Why: Release notes take ~6 hrs/release; errors cause churn. Target: ≤1 hr, zero missed validations.

What: Generate notes per sprint; tag modules to test; publish to Confluence. Non-goals: prod rollback automation.

How: Parse Jira + PRs, map to components, template notes; KPIs: prep time, consumer defects.

Plan/Cost: Spike (Oct 1–4) → Pilot (Oct 7–18) → Org rollout (Nov 1–15); 2 FTE-weeks.

Risk: Inconsistent Jira usage → add guardrails; noisy diffs → filter by labels; consumer adoption → champions in 3 teams.

Proof: 1-sprint pilot showed 72% time reduction.

Next step: Approve pilot scope and 2 FTE-weeks by Sep 30.


Use this skeleton and your proposals will read crisp, quantifiable, and decision-ready.
