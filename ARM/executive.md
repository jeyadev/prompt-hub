Here’s a crisp, exec-friendly blueprint you can walk into the room with—and it’s technically tight enough for your SREs to start building today.

Agentic Runbook Memory (ARM)

A memory- and personalization-driven “runbook copilot” that routes on-call questions through a curated, living corpus of past incidents, playbooks, SLOs, and data-source queries. It narrows context to what actually matters (service, symptom, env), then executes tool calls (Splunk/APM/Prometheus/Confluence/ITSM) and returns an action-ready plan. Monitoring outputs stay disciplined: only pages, tickets, or logs—no inbox spam.


---

1) Solution (runnable spec + code)

A. Target outcomes (business & reliability)

Cut MTTR 2–3× by using precomputed playbooks and one-click tool queries; playbooks historically deliver ~3× MTTR improvement vs “winging it.”

Reduce on-call noise to ≤2 actionable pages per 8–12h shift via SLO-aligned alerting and dedup.

Shift ops → engineering by eliminating toil and email-style alerts.

Govern change velocity with error budgets so reliability and launches stay aligned.


B. High-level architecture (build in 3 sprints)

Ingestors

Splunk, APM (Dynatrace), Prometheus, ITSM (Jira/ServiceNow), Confluence crawlers.

Incident postmortems and SLO dashboards are parsed into ARM entries.


Memory store (hybrid)

Postgres + pgvector (semantic search) for “issue memories” and embeddings.

Object storage for playbook markdown & artifacts.


Orchestrator

Agent graph (e.g., LangGraph or function-calling) with tools:
lookup_runbook, search_splunk, get_dynatrace, query_promql, open_confluence, update_incident.


Policy/Governance

RBAC via SSO, audit log on all tool invocations, PII scrubbing.


UX

Slack/Teams slash command and a web pane inside your on-call dashboard.


C. Data model (DDL you can apply)

-- Requires pgvector extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

CREATE TABLE runbook_memory (
  issue_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  service TEXT NOT NULL,
  env TEXT CHECK (env IN ('prod','staging','dev')),
  tags TEXT[] NOT NULL,                    -- e.g., {'kafka','timeout','5xx','us-east'}
  symptom TEXT NOT NULL,                   -- human summary
  slo_ref TEXT,                            -- link to SLO object
  severity TEXT CHECK (severity IN ('SEV1','SEV2','SEV3')),
  detection_rules JSONB,                   -- { "promql": "...", "spl": "...", "dynatrace": {...} }
  runbook_md TEXT NOT NULL,                -- canonical playbook in markdown
  confluence_urls TEXT[],
  owners TEXT[],                           -- team emails
  escalation_policy_id TEXT,
  last_verified TIMESTAMPTZ,
  last_seen TIMESTAMPTZ,
  embedding VECTOR(1536)                   -- text-embedding of [symptom + runbook + tags]
);

CREATE INDEX ON runbook_memory USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
CREATE INDEX ON runbook_memory (service, env);

Example entry (trimmed)

{
  "service": "checkout-api",
  "env": "prod",
  "tags": ["5xx","db-connection-pool","spike","deploy-window"],
  "symptom": "P95 latency spikes with 5xx bursts post-deploy",
  "slo_ref": "slo://checkout-api-availability",
  "severity": "SEV2",
  "detection_rules": {
    "promql": "(
      (sum(rate(http_requests_total{job=\"checkout\",status=~\"5..\"}[5m])) /
       sum(rate(http_requests_total{job=\"checkout\"}[5m])))
     ) > 0.02",
    "spl": "index=prod sourcetype=nginx service=checkout status>=500 | timechart count",
    "dynatrace": { "metric": "builtin:service.errors.server.rate",
                   "entitySelector": "type(SERVICE),tag(service:checkout-api)" }
  },
  "runbook_md": "## Triage\n1) Check burn rate...\n2) Rollback if ...\n## Root-cause hints\n- Known issue with pool saturation...",
  "confluence_urls": ["https://confluence/.../checkout-latency-playbook"],
  "owners": ["sre-checkout@company.com"],
  "escalation_policy_id": "ep_checkout_api"
}

D. Retrieval & action flow (agent behavior)

1. Route & narrow context: infer service/env from the user prompt or incident.


2. Vector + filter: SELECT ... ORDER BY embedding <-> q LIMIT 5 where q is the query embedding; filter service=... AND env=....


3. Assemble plan: stitch top-k runbook steps + live data queries (PromQL/SPL/Dynatrace) tied to that memory row.


4. Execute tools for fresh metrics; output one of three valid monitoring outcomes: page (now), ticket (soon), or just log.



E. Example agent “tool contracts” (JSON schemas)

{
  "name": "search_splunk",
  "args_schema": {
    "index": "string", "query": "string", "earliest": "string", "latest": "string"
  },
  "returns": { "events": "array", "stats": "object", "link": "string" }
}

Similar for get_dynatrace(entitySelector, metric, window), query_promql(query), open_confluence(url), update_incident(id, note).

F. SLO/burn-rate alert rules (Prometheus; page vs ticket)

groups:
- name: slo-burn
  rules:
  - alert: FastBurn_5m
    expr: ( slo:error_ratio:rate5m{service="checkout"} ) > 0.14
    for: 5m
    labels: {severity: page}
    annotations:
      summary: "SLO fast-burn (5m) > 14% — paging"
  - alert: SlowBurn_1h
    expr: ( slo:error_ratio:rate1h{service="checkout"} ) > 0.02
    for: 60m
    labels: {severity: ticket}
    annotations:
      summary: "SLO slow-burn (1h) > 2% — create ticket"

(Use multi-window multi-burn patterns; tie to SLO, not raw CPU noise.)


---

2) Data Reasoning (why this works)

Playbooks → MTTR: Pre-thought steps & known fixes improve MTTR by ~3×; ARM keeps them verified and discoverable by symptom.

Alert outputs: Forcing outcomes to page/ticket/log prevents alert fatigue and makes routing explicit.

Error budgets: Reliability target is a product choice; error budgets align dev & SRE and gate release velocity, which ARM visualizes in context.

Ops cap & toil: ARM removes repetitive lookups and manual triage, supporting the “≤50% ops” rule and healthier on-call.


Heuristics we’ll start with:

Top-k = 5 memories; similarity ≥0.75 cosine; if <0.6, fall back to “generic triage” playbook.

Confidence bands: show variance of recent error ratios vs the runbook’s historic baseline; only page when outside a 95% band and burning budget.



---

3) Systems Analysis (trade-offs & feedback loops)

Staleness risk: If runbooks drift, guidance decays. Mitigate with “last_verified” SLA (e.g., 90 days) and auto-nag owners when stale.

Over-automation: Blindly running fixes can hide root causes. Keep “dry-run” mode and require human confirm on destructive steps.

Noise migration: Bad monitoring → bad memory. Enforce the page/ticket/log contract and tie paging only to SLO symptoms.

Release velocity tension: ARM surfaces error-budget spend so product naturally throttles pushes near budget exhaustion.



---

4) Validation & Simulation (prove it before rollout)

Offline replay (30–90 days):

Re-run last quarter’s SEV1–SEV3 incidents; measure:
ΔMTTR, time_to_first_correct_action, pages_per_shift, precision@k for memory retrieval, “ticket deflection rate.”


Queries & checks

PromQL (error ratio):

sum(rate(http_requests_total{job="checkout",status=~"5.."}[5m])) 
/ sum(rate(http_requests_total{job="checkout"}[5m]))

Splunk (5xx bursts):

index=prod service=checkout status>=500 earliest=-1h latest=now()
| bin _time span=1m | stats count by _time, status

Dynatrace: pull builtin:service.errors.server.rate for entitySelector=type(SERVICE),tag(service:checkout-api) and plot vs deploy windows.


Human-in-the-loop

After each incident, ARM drafts a new/updated memory row from chat, logs, and the postmortem; owner approves or edits.



---

5) Ops-Ready Summary (what you’ll say in the room)

What it is: An agentic, SLO-aware runbook copilot that narrows context, executes the right queries, and proposes actions tied to playbooks.

Why now: Cuts MTTR by leveraging playbooks (historically ~3× improvement) and ends email-alert chaos with strict page/ticket/log routing.

Governance: Error budgets gate risky pushes; ARM makes spend visible and self-policing.

Guardrails: RBAC, audit logs, PII scrub, “break-glass” paths for critical edits are logged and back-annotated.

Rollout: Start with 1–2 critical services, 25–40 high-value memories, and a replay test suite. Success = ↓MTTR, ≤2 pages/shift, ↑ticket deflection.

Appendix: Minimal service to power retrieval (FastAPI)

from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
import psycopg2, psycopg2.extras
import numpy as np

app = FastAPI()

def embed(text: str) -> np.ndarray:
    # Call your embedding model; return 1536-dim vector
    ...

def rows_to_dto(rows):
    return [{"issue_id": r["issue_id"], "service": r["service"], "symptom": r["symptom"],
             "runbook_md": r["runbook_md"], "detection_rules": r["detection_rules"],
             "owners": r["owners"], "confluence_urls": r["confluence_urls"]} for r in rows]

@app.get("/search")
def search(service: str, env: str="prod", q: str=Query(...), k: int=5):
    v = embed(q).tolist()
    sql = """
      SELECT *, 1 - (embedding <=> %s::vector) AS sim
      FROM runbook_memory
      WHERE service=%s AND env=%s
      ORDER BY embedding <-> %s::vector
      LIMIT %s;
    """
    with psycopg2.connect(...) as conn, conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.RealDictCursor) as cur:
        cur.execute(sql, (v, service, env, v, k))
        rows = cur.fetchall()
    return {"results": rows_to_dto(rows)}

How you pitch it in one breath

“ARM is our runbook copilot. It remembers exactly how we’ve solved past incidents and personalizes the next fix to the service, environment, and SLO impact. It runs the right queries, opens the right docs, and proposes the next best action. That means fewer noisy pages, faster recovery—think 2–3× MTTR improvements—and a cleaner path to ship features without blowing our error budget.”

If you want, I can turn this into a 1-page slide with the architecture, KPIs, and a 90-day rollout plan next.
