Got you — narratively it flows MUCH better if the “integration” scenes (break-up + dispenser + Go/Learning) happen **before** the Mid-Year Check-In and Appraisal arc.

And I’ll adjust that *“once they finally sat”* narration as you requested — cleaner, quirkier, and snappier.

Below is the **updated narration order**, with Scene 6 (Certificates) → Scene 5 (Break-up/Dispenser) → THEN Mid-Year → THEN Appraisal.

I’m only rewriting the narration sections that need adjustment.

---

# ✅ **UPDATED NARRATOR LINES with Corrected Scene Order & Better Flow**

---

## 🎬 SCENE 1 – JPMorgan Main Entrance

**Opening Narration**

> Every corporate legend begins with a gate.
> At JPMC, it also begins with a guard who speaks in rules, not vibes.

**Closing Narration**

> And that’s onboarding Step 1: no KGF entry needed — just your **mobile badge** and a little humility.

---

## 🎬 SCENE 2 – Biometrics Blunder

**Opening Narration**

> Gate? Done. Now the joiners face their next mini-boss: the Biometric Machine…
> A device that recognises thousands of employees but refuses to recognise your inner Tom Cruise.

**Closing Narration**

> Remember: in this office, **your badge does the spy work**.
> Nose scans are not officially supported.

---

## 🎬 SCENE 3 – Seat Saga

**Opening Narration**

> Our heroes have passed security and biometrics.
> Now comes the real challenge: *finding a seat before someone else marks it as their kingdom*.

**Closing Narration**

> Hot desking rulebook: Book your seat, trust the system, and don’t use Joker figurines as legal markers.

---

## 🎬 SCENE 4 – OKR Day

*(With your corrected line)*

**Opening Narration**

> Now that they’ve *finally* sat, they unlock a brand-new level:
> **Performance Goals & OKRs** — where “I’ll do my work” magically transforms into “drive transformational uplift in ecosystem reliability.”

**Closing Narration**

> All that poetry lives safely inside the **performance tool**.
> Type clearly today so future-you doesn’t need a Rosetta Stone later.

---

# 🔄 ***SCENE ORDER NOW SWAPS: 6 → 5 → 7 → 8***

This is the logical arc:

1. OKR Day
2. Certificate Saga
3. Break-Up + Dispenser
4. Mid-Year
5. Appraisal
6. Year-End Party

—

## 🎬 SCENE 6 – “The Certificate Saga – The JPMC Way”

*(now BEFORE Mid-Year Check-In)*

**Opening Narration**

> While the OKRs settle into the tool, our joiner dives into a new world:
> Weekend upskilling — the great Indian hobby that defeats sleep, sanity, and Sundays.

**Closing Narration**

> And the best part? At JPMC, **Go/Learning** gives you all that for free.
> Learn smart — and let your wallet live.

---

## 🎬 SCENE 5 – “The Break-Up Break… and The Water Dispenser Boss Fight”

*(this now comes BEFORE mid-year, which makes sense)*

**Opening Narration**

> Corporate life isn’t just tickets and tools — it’s also Mondays, breakups, and that one pantry machine that tests your emotional stability.

**Closing Narration**

> Heartbreak may need time,
> but **leave at JPMC is auto-approved**.
> Click once, cool down, and let the dispenser be your only toxic relationship.

---

## 🎬 SCENE 7 – MID-YEAR CHECK-IN

*(now the timing makes sense — after settling in)*

**Opening Narration**

> Six months in, the universe asks the deadliest question in corporate history:
> “So… what exactly did you do?”
> Welcome to the Mid-Year Check-In.

**Closing Narration**

> Corporate survival rule #1:
> **If it’s not in the tool, it didn’t happen.**
> So type it — before the tool forgets you faster than your manager does.

---

## 🎬 SCENE 8 – APPRAISAL DAY

*(same order, now after consistent build-up)*

### ⭐ Calibration Room

**Opening Narration**

> Behind every rating lies a secret council called Calibration —
> a place where “Strong”, “OnTrack”, “Potential” and “History” negotiate passionately.

**Closing Narration**

> And thus, one Strong becomes one beautifully decorated **OnTrack** —
> powered by SOG, diplomacy, and ancient corporate rituals.

---

### ⭐ Actual Appraisal Conversation

**Opening Narration**

> Now from the war-room to the meeting room — where managers translate your year’s effort into Corporate Sanskrit with remarkable confidence.

**Closing Narration**

> “Solid OnTrack with Stretch Elements.”
> Also known as:
> **“Amazing work, kindly do even more next year.”**

---

## 🎬 SCENE 9 – YEAR-END PARTY

**Opening Narration**

> After one full orbit around the corporate sun — tickets, OKRs, mid-year, appraisal and emotional damage — one ritual unites everyone: the Year-End Party.

**Closing Narration (final close)**

> And that completes the loop of our Corporate Inception —
> Gates, badges, seats, OKRs, Go/Learning, leave, check-ins, appraisals, and people who make it all survivable.
> Remember: tools will change, portals will evolve,
> but sanity, humour, and good colleagues keep you **OnTrack**.

If you'd like, I can:
✔ Add **transition voiceovers** between scenes
✔ Create a **single master narrator script** with clear cue markers
✔ Add **MC jokes** between scenes
✔ Add *one-line tool shout-outs* to reinforce JPMC culture

Just tell me how tight or elaborate you want it.
